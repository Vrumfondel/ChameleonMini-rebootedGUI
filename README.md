Read the [changelog](https://github.com/iceman1001/ChameleonMini-rebootedGUI/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for information of what is new. 

prerequisite
* dot.net 4.6.2
* Application needs full rights.

The applications is being deployed with Click-Once technology so the application phones home to see if there is an update available everytime you start it.  If there is an update you get an choice to install or skip.  I do recommend that you update. If you think this is not good for your privacy,  feel free to block the application from reaching internet.  It should work just fine but I haven't tested it. If you do, please let me know if it works.  :)
